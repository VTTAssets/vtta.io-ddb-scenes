## Folder structure

```
- [Code]
   - Scenes

```

Please keep the directory structure as-is. It is generated by the sourcebook parser, and all paths are sanitized by the following algorithm to replace operating system restricted special characters with regular, unique strings.

```javascript
/**
 * Sanitizes a string to a valid filepath, by replacing each reserved character by a unique string literal.
 * The process is therefore reversable
 * @param {string} filepath
 * @returns sanitized string
 */
const sanitize = (str) => {
  [":", "\\?", "\\/", "<", ">", "\\\\", "\\*", "\\|", '\\"'].forEach(
    (char, index) => {
      const replacement = ` -${"#".repeat(index + 1)}- `;
      const regex = new RegExp(char, "g");
      str = str.replace(regex, replacement);
    }
  );
  return str;
};

/**
 * Reverts the sanitized filepath to it's original string
 * @param {string} filepath
 * @returns original string
 */
const unsanitize = (str) => {
  [":", "?", "/", "<", ">", "\\", "*", "|", '"'].forEach((char, index) => {
    const replacement = ` -${"#".repeat(index + 1)}- `;
    const regex = new RegExp(replacement, "g");
    str = str.replace(regex, char);
  });
  return str;
};
