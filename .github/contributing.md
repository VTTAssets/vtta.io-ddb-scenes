# Contributing to the repository

You can contribute to this repository to increase the quality of an individual scene or sourcebook by creating a pull request for it. Please follow the following guidelines to make this process as smooth and painless for everyone as possible, thanks!

## 1. Describe your changes meaningfully

Especially if you send in adjustments for e.g. walls, make sure that the reviewer finds the changes portion of the map easily (screenshots would be best). If you are correcting errors (secret doors are regular wall elements, e.g.), then the change is way quicker to process than changes to walling because it follows your own personal preference. Keep in mind that people are using Foundry that are running the game on potatoes, so find a good in-between between details and reasonable wall counts.

## 2. Make a pull request for each individually changed scene

Making a pull request for each scene that you submit adjustments for allows detailed discussion about your choices and feedback on them from other contributors. If makes accepting certain pull requests while discussing others possible, therefore speeding up the process as a whole.

## 3. Check if PRs for a specific scene are already in queue

Reviewing the changes and approving/discussing them is a community endevour, and therefore might take a moment to complete. Before submitting a PR for a scene, check if adjustments for the same scene are already in queue. If possible, review that PR and comment on it to speed things up, too.
